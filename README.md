# IntroCS(2020/21-Winter Semester)/CS50X(2020)

This project includes the solutions to the problem sets/exercises of IntroCS course by FAU as well and CS50X by Harvard University. Likewise, it also includes the the practice examples that I did for exam preparations.

CS50X is a popular online course offered by Harvard University, which covers the fundamentals of computer science, programming, and web development. It is an introductory course, designed to teach students with little to no programming experience. The course covers a range of topics, including:

- C programming
- Algorithms and data structures
- Memory management
- Python programming
- Web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask

CS50X is offered online for free, and students from all over the world can enroll in the course. The course consists of lectures, problem sets, and quizzes, and it is designed to be challenging and rewarding for students. By the end of the course, students should have a solid foundation in computer science and programming, and be able to apply these skills to real-world problems.

IntroCS is an introductory course offered by Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU), which covers the fundamentals of computer science, programming, and software development. The course is designed to teach students the basics of programming using the Java programming language. The course covers a range of topics, including:

- Basic programming concepts (e.g. variables, data types, loops, conditionals)
- Object-oriented programming concepts (e.g. classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Data structures (e.g. arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)
- Algorithms (e.g. searching, sorting)
- Basic software engineering concepts (e.g. debugging, testing, documentation)

The course is taught in the Winter Semester, and is primarily aimed at undergraduate students who have little to no programming experience. By the end of the course, students should have a solid foundation in programming and be able to write simple programs in Java.

This project includes my solutions to the problem sets and exercises of CS50X, as well as the practice examples that I did to prepare for exams.
