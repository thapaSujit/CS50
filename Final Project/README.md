# CS50x Final Project

As part of the final project for the cs50x, i created a website and gave the name as tourism in Nepal. 
It contains all the information about tourism in Nepal. There are basicall 3 different tabs in the website and they are: HOME, EXPERIENCES, AND PLACES TO VISIT.

The home tab contains information about tourism in Nepal at glance. It is a short description of what can you expect when you visit Nepal. Here, you will get to 
see the beautiful pictures of Nepal that will change automatically.  At the end of this tab,myou will get link to official website, official facebook and 
official intagram for tourism in Nepal. Similarly, there is a serch option where you can type and search anything and this will redirect you to the offficial 
google search.

Likewise, in the experience tab, you get inforation about different kind of experiences that you can get in Nepal. It describes various experiences that you can
get in Nepal that you would cherish for life. When you click read more in the subsection, it will lead you to the weebpage containing more information about these
experiences.

In the last tab, you get information aout the various touristic destinations off Nepal with short description. If you want to get more delailed inforation, you4
can click read more in each ssection.

At the end, i would like to thanks professor David for providing this course free. This has to be the best MOOC course that i have taken. As Professor David said,
the goal is not to compare with your friend but to compare yourself with what you have gained. I believe, i have gained a lot during these three months.
