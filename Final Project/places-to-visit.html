                    Pokhara is a city on Phewa Lake, in central Nepal. It’s known as a gateway to the Annapurna Circuit, a popular trail in the Himalayas. Pokhara, the 'Tourist Capital of Nepal,' is the second-largest city in this Himalayan country, after Kathmandu. At an altitude of more than 900m, it is one of the highest cities, making it the base for many world-famous treks.

                <p>
                    This city is charming, busy, bustling, serene, alive and asleep - all at once. The capital of Nepal, Kathmandu is the most accessible city in the country - it is Nepal's only metropolitan city as well. From buying trekking equipment in Thamel or taking a rickshaw ride through traffic-packed alleys of the old part of the city or simply visiting the fascinating buildings in Durbar Squares, Kathmandu is truly a place filled with warmth.
                    Kathmandu is an abode of serenity and tranquillity, with its monasteries, temples and spiritual melting pots.

Nevertheless, the city has been getting back on its feet steadily over the past 4 years.

                <p>
                    Far away from the bustling town squares and temples and dance festivals of the towns and cities of Nepal, the village of Kagbeni awaits you with its audacious beauty. Officially Kagbeni is a settlement that bridges the gap between Lower and Upper Mustang, right at the feet of Muktinath Valley by the River Kali Gandaki. But spiritually, Kagbeni is every bit of a Tibetan village, stuck somewhere in between centuries

                <p>
                    Pretty as a picture - that is how one can perfectly describe Bandipur. This living and breathing abode of Newari culture is a hilltop settlement in the Gandaki Zone at 1030 metres, some 700 metres above the Marsyangdi River. The municipality snuggles itself on the saddle of the Mahabharat Range of the Himalayas. Bandipur is a perfect weekend retreat from Kathmandu or Pokhara, now that it is connected with the highway by an access road.
